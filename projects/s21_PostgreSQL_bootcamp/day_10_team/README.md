# Data Warehouse Project - Currency Analysis

## Task 1: Aggregate User Balances
Create a SQL query to calculate total transaction volumes from user balances, aggregated by user and balance type. Handle cases with missing data:
- Replace NULL names with 'not defined'
- Use the latest currency rate
- Calculate total volume in USD

## Task 2: Currency Conversion Analysis
Write a SQL query to display all users with their balance transactions converted to USD using the nearest available exchange rate (either before or after the transaction date).
